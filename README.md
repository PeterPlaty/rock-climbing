This game is about a rock climbing a mountain using a ball. Failures should be somewhat punishing and fair.

The ball can be spawned Gimmick-like by holding X. As long as the player holds X, the player will hold the ball.
- When X is released, the player throws the ball
- When X is released while holding the down arrow, the player drops the ball on the ground next to them. Jumping on the ball in this state gives the player a vertical boost

The player can move horizontally (left-right keys) and can do a short hop.

IMPORTANT TO DO:
- Jump on ball pogo-like
- Push ball in bounds only horizontally (not vertically)
- Slope touch makes player fall only if *descending*
- "Tutorial" to teach controls
- Push ball in bounds properly
- Build-up the throw (can't spam)
- Press C while bouncing gives extra boost

TO DO:
- Jump also with space
- Audio & Particles
- If I'm not tired, add tileset
- Calculate bounce angle of the ball

IF THERE'S TIME:
- Menu
- Remappable controls
- Fall if at the edge
- Add swirly animation for the stars


TO KEEP AN EYE ON:
- Sometimes, the player falls through the ball without jumping. Worst case scenario: do precise collisions for the ball
