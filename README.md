This game is about a rock climbing a mountain using a ball. Failures should be somewhat punishing and fair.

The ball can be spawned Gimmick-like by holding X. As long as the player holds X, the player will hold the ball.
- When X is released, the player throws the ball
- When X is released while holding the down arrow, the player drops the ball on the ground next to them. Jumping on the ball in this state gives the player a vertical boost

The player can move horizontally (left-right keys) and can do a short hop.

TO DO:
- Calculate bounce angle of the ball
- Push in bounds from slope
- Remove jump when stabilized

IF THERE'S TIME:
- Fall if at the edge
- Add swirly animation for the stars


TO KEEP AN EYE ON:
- Sometimes, the player falls through the ball without jumping. Worst case scenario: do precise collisions for the ball
